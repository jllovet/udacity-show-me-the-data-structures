# Udacity - Show Me The Data Structures

This is a project in the Udacity Data Structures and Algorithms nanodegree wherein I have to solve a series of open-ended practice problems. It is intended to hone my skills to identify and implement appropriate data structures and corresponding methods that meet given constraints.

## Overview of the project from Udacity
For this project, you will answer the six questions laid out in the next sections. The questions cover a variety of topics related to the data structures you've learned in this course. You will write up a clean and efficient answer in Python, as well as a text explanation of the efficiency of your code and your design choices.

A qualified reviewer, such as a software or data engineer, will look over your answer and give you detailed, written feedback on areas you're doing very well in and areas that could be improved. For example, is your solution the most efficient one possible? Are you doing a good job of explaining your thoughts? Is your code elegant and easy to read?

## Requirements from Udacity (Slightly Condensed)
- **Answer all 6 problems** listed in the previous concepts.
- **Code solutions must each be in a separate file like `problem_1.py`.** You can submit your answers by uploading a single .zip file or connecting to your GitHub repo.
- For each question, **create a solution in Python (version 3).** All solutions should be functions named as laid out in the concepts. Feel free to make additional helper functions or classes as needed.
- In the respective `problem_1.py` files, **include at least 3 test cases for each solution.**
    - For each test case, write the function call with the input you want to test and print it to the console".
    - On the next line, **comment out the output you expect to see from that function call.** At least 2 of these must be edge cases, testing inputs such as null values, empty inputs, unusually large values, etc.
- **Write up an explanation for each question** in a single separate text, PDF, or markdown file.
    - Your paragraph should not be a detailed walkthrough of the code you provided, but provide your reasoning behind decisions made in the code. For example, why did you use that data structure?
    - You also need to explain **both time efficiency and space efficiency** of your solution.
- **Note:** Time complexity for reading the input will not be considered in the overall complexity of the solution.

## Notes on my Documentation
I am writing my documentation in LaTeX. A more in-depth explanation of the tools I use to work with LaTeX can be found in one of my other repositories, [jllovet/iue-bs-math](https://github.com/jllovet/iue-bs-math/tree/main/000-setup).

The tl;dr is that I am using the LaTeX Workshop plugin in VSCode, along with a docker container that has all of the LaTeX packages I am interested in using. This allows me to generate the LaTeX as I go. I made this to make CICD for my LaTeX docs possible in other projects.
